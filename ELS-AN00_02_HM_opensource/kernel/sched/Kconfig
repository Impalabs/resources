config SCHED_WALT_WINDOW_SIZE_TUNABLE
	bool "Make WALT window size tunable"
	default n
	help
	  Make walt_ravg_window tunable in early param.

config SCHED_DOWNMIGRATE_LOWER_LOAD
	bool "Schedutil governor use lower load when task downmigrate"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_GOV_SCHEDUTIL
	default n
	help
	  Schedutil governor migrate cpu busy time when task migrate. This
	  option will recaculate a lower load for task downmigrate to
	  prevent little core's frequency increase too much.

config SCHED_CALC_CUM_WINDOW_DEMAND
	bool "WALT calculate cum window demand"
	depends on SCHED_USE_WALT
	default n
	help
	  This option caculates WALT's cum_window_demand, which is not used
	  currently.

config SCHED_CHECK_IRQLOAD
	bool "Scheduler check irqload when select task's cpu"
	default y
	help
	  WALT caculates an irqload for each cpu and scheduler will avoid
	  placing task on a high irqload cpu (if WALT enabled).
	  Default disabled because we haven't tested to find out which
	  threshold is the best.

config SCHED_TOP_TASK
	bool "Maintain the top task load of each cpu"
	default y
	help
	  Schedutil governor may use the top task load as a guide to
	  frequency evaluation.

config SCHED_USE_WALT
	bool "Scheduler use WALT for cpu util and task util"
	default y
	help
	  This option enables calculation of WALT's task_util/cpu_util
	  signal, and sets sysctl_sched_use_walt_[cpu/task]_util to 1.

	  When enabled, you can still change the sysctl node to
	  enable or disable walt signal for debug purpose.

config SCHED_MIGRATE_SPREAD_LOAD
	bool "Spread task's load when inter-cluster migration"
	default y
	help
	  In inter-cluster migration, this option will spread task's
	  prev_window/curr_window to all cpus that the task has been
	  running on before in a window. If disabled, task's whole load
	  will move to dest cpu and that will make dest cpu's cpu load
	  very high in same cases.

config SCHED_TOP_TASK_SKIP_HISPEED_LOGIC
	bool "Let top task ignore above_hipeed_delay"
	depends on SCHED_TOP_TASK
	default y
	help
	  For schedutil governor, this option skips hispeed logic when
	  ADD_TOP_TASK event triggers freq update.

config SCHED_PRED_LOAD
	bool "Calculate predicted load for each task"
	default y
	depends on CPU_FREQ_GOV_SCHEDUTIL_OPT
	help
	  Another signal to improve schedutil. This will help to ramp up
	  cpufreq quickly.
	  To enable this signal, say yes here and set predl_enable to 1
	  in init rc.

	bool "Rotate running tasks between clusters"
	default y
	depends on HISI_EAS_SCHED
	depends on ED_TASK && !ED_TASK_RESET_AT_UPMIGRATION
	select SCHED_RUNNING_AVG
	help
	  When there are 8 big tasks running parallelly, e.g. geekbench
	  multicore, tasks which were initially run on big cores will
	  finish its job very soon and then there will be 6 or less tasks
	  left.
	  Rotate the tasks, or in other words exchange them between
	  little cores and big cores randomly, will improve fairness and
	  parallelism.

config SCHED_DEBUG_TRACE
	bool "Detailed trace for EAS debug"
	default n
	help
	  This option enable detailed tracepoint for EAS debug, there
	  will be more tracepoint in find best target, load balance and
	  energy diff.

	bool "Sched optimization deprecated code"
	default n
	help
	  Due to old platforms still alive, these code can't be deleted now.
	  They have been deprecated in the new platform.

	  New platform, say no. If unsure, say Y.

	default n

config SCHED_FRAME_NO_FORCE_FAST_DOWN
	bool "Schedutil frame_update do not force skip_min_sample_time"
	depends on !SCHED_DEPRECATED
	default y
	help
	  Boosted scene like appstart do not want cpu to fast ramp
	  down. Frame sched should not break it. This option won't
	  set skip_min_sample_time for freq update marked by
	  sched_set_group_normalized_util() if userspace has
	  configured fast_ramp_down to 0.
	  Please say Y.
