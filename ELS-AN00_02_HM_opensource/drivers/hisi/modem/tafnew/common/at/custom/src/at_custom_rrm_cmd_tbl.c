     * [类别]: 协议AT-与AP对接
     * [含义]: DSDS产品设置多Modem模式
     * [说明]: 该命令针对DSDS双卡双待单通手机产品，用于上层AP在Modem开机前设置Modem为多Modem模式或单Modem模式。
     *         此命令只能在DSDS双卡单待产品上使用。
     *         命令必须是在Modem开机之前设置，开机后才会生效。
     * [语法]:
     *     [命令]: ^ACTIVEMODEM=<mode>
     *     [结果]: 执行成功时：
     *             <CR><LF>OK<CR><LF>
     *             有MT 相关错误时：
     *             <CR><LF>+CME ERROR: <err_code><CR><LF>
     * [参数]:
     *     <mode>: 整型值，设置多Modem模式：
     *             0：单Modem模式；
     *             1：多Modem模式。
     * [示例]:
     *     ・ 设置Modem为单Modem模式
     *       AT^ACTIVEMODEM=0
     *       OK
     *     ・ 设置Modem为多Modem模式
     *       AT^ACTIVEMODEM=1
     *       OK
